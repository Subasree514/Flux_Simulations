### Codes to simulate the RS model integrated plant metabolic core model
RS model depicting various reactive species and antioxidant enzymatic reactions suitable for plant metabolism was constructed. RS model previously reconstructed for huma metabolism was used as a template

### Codes to update the metabolic models with total demand reactions for the reactive species
https://github.com/Subasree514/Flux_Simulations/tree/trial/RS%20demands contains the codes to add demand reactions for
  1. Core metabolic model - core_demands.py
  2. Extended core metabolic model - Extended_core_demands.py
